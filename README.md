🌐 Street Smart - Your Urban Explorer

I created this really cool app in TitanHacks 2023(24Hrs coding challange at CSUF). This app notifies user about must visit places nearby. While travelling, when user leaves 5miles radius from its last location, chatGPT api gets triggered and based on that location and preset prompts, user will be notified about must visit places nearby. This app uses live tracking and real time notifications.

Features that Make Street Smart Shine:

📍 Live Tracking: Keep pace with your surroundings in real-time.

🚗 Intelligent Notifications: Street Smart activates the ChatGPT API when you venture beyond a 5-mile radius from your last used location.

📱 React Native: Built with React Native, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.
